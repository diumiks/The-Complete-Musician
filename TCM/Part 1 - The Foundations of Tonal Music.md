# Tonality in Context: Bach's Violin Partita No.3, Prelude

**Terms**
1. Bar lines: 小节线
2. Measure: 小节
3. Accent: 重音
4. Leap: 跳进
5. Hierarchy: a defining feature of tonal music
6. Tonic Pitch: 主音

**Basic criteria of important pitch**
1. How often the pitch appears
2. degree to which other pitches are drawn to it
3. its prominence as part of musical gestures

**How to create pitch prominence**
1. Something new of different
2.  Some melodic gestures end and another begins
3. Longer pitches
4. Pitches that occur on beats
5. When an accented duration and metric placement align - create a strong accent

## Charting Musical Sound: Staff and Clef

**Important principles of tonal music**
1. Pitch prominence
2. Musical accent
3. Melodic contour
4. Hierarchy

### Pitches and Pitch Classes

**What is pitch?**
Pitch generated by a vibrating body. The speed of the regularly recurring vibrations - ***frequency*** - determines the pitch. If a pitch's frequency is twice that of another pitch, then the two pitches are separated by an **octave**.

**Pitch and Octave Designations**

## The Division of Musical Space: Intervals

Definition: The distance between any two pitches is called an **Interval**. An octave's span is a criteria, was divided into seven **steps**. These steps are two different sizes. The smaller step is called a **half step**. The larger step is called **whole step**.

### Accidentals

There are seven steps in an octave but have 12 keys in keyboard. To indicate those 12 keys, we add various modifiers called **chromatic alterations** or **accidentals**.

- ♯ sharp
- ♭ flat
- ♮ natural
- 𝄪 double sharp
- 𝄫 double flat

### Scale - *Scala*

Diatonic Scale: 自然音阶
Chromatic Scale: 变化音阶

**Two different name of half step**
There have two different name of half step and they have different characteristic: If this half step is in the D. Scale, we call it **diatonic half step**, else we call it **chromatic half step**. Additionally, diatonic half step include two different letter names. Chromatic half step share the same letter name. 

### Enharmonicism

Definition: If there are some pitches such as C♭ and B, it have same location in keyboard but different name, we call it **enharmonically equivalent**.

**How to use accidentals when enharmonically equivalent pitch?**
There are two general principles:
- Use the note name that represent membership within the prevailing key
- use sharps (or naturals) in ascending lines and flat (or naturals) in descending lines

**Meaning of enharmonicism in different instruments**
For the moveable-pitch instruments, such as violin, player will play sharp pitch higher and flat pitch lower commonly. (e.g. player G♯ higher will intensify the expected ascending motion to A)

### Scale Degree Number and Names

**Tips**
Scale degree numbers are distinguished by the caret, or cap, that is placed above each number in oder to avoid confusion with other numbers with different meanings. (e.g. 1^ 2^ 3^ 4^)

### Minor Mode

Composers often rearrange the melodic motion of the final three pitches. These variations take three forms called the **harmonic minor scale**, **melodic minor scale** and **natural minor scale**.

### Harmonic and Melodic Minor Scales

Those two variations of the minor scale as a means of creating both this goal directed motion and a smooth melodic line. Thus natural minor scale's 7<sup>^</sup> to 8<sup>^</sup>pitches is a whole step, and to increase more goal-oriented motion via raising 7<sup>^</sup> pitch to create a leading tone.

**Harmonic minor scale**


**Melodic minor scale**
Compare with the harmonic minor scale, Melodic Minor Scale raising the 6th and 7th pitches, it can gain smooth melodic motion and leading tone. But in the descending, MMS will as same as the natural minor scale to enhance the descent toward to 5th.

Additionally, in Melodic Minor Scale, we call the lower 7th the **subtonic** rather than the leading tone. Because it doesn't have the same function as the leading tone, rather, it is the crucial first step in a falling line that leads toward the dominant.
